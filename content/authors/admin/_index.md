Ecologist, data analyst, public speaker.  

I have a strong connection to the sea and the natural world around us. Nature fascinates me and I enjoy using data to explore this world and have meaningful insights on the environment and its inhabitants. I believe that communicating scientific insights through graphical and visual tools helps connecting people with science and nature.
At the moment I work part-time as an ecologist in HaMaarag, which performs ecological monitoring across Israel, estimating the country's state of nature. I also offer data wrangling services and I teach university courses and lectures.
